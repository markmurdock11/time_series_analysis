## Time Series Forecasting Conclusions

### 1. Would I purchase the yen now?

I would not purchase the yen now. My ARMA and ARIMA models project a positive return over the next five days, however, this positive return is minimal. I believe there are better assets that I could put my money into. The one saving grace for the yen is the GARCH model, is an increase in volatitlity over the next five days. This could be used to maximize trading profits. As an investment the yen is a low end yield asset, but it could be a better tool for trade. 

### 2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Based on my GARCH model, the volatility of the Yen is expected to increase. Volatility is a synonym for risk, meaning the price has the potential to increase or decrease at a higher rate. If I were to be trading the yen, this would be very exciting. 

### 3. Based on the model evaluation, do I feel confident in using these models for trading? 

I would not be 100% comfortable with using these models for trading. The p value for my models work for p=.05, however, I would want to decrease the p value to under .0001 before I started putting money where my model projected. 


## Linear Regression Forecasting Conclusions

### 1. Does this model perform better or worse on out of sample data or in sample data?

The model performs better on out of sample data. I came to this conclusion because my root mean squared error (RMSE) is slightly higher when using in sample data. The RMSE is important because it gives an idea of how the model does with errors. The lower the number, the simpler the and better the model (aka Occams Razor)
